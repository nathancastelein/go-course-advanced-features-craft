# Exercise 2

In [queue.go](./queue.go), we defined a new Queue structure for integers. 

Let's rewrite the code to use generics, so the Queue will be usable for any type!

You can check [map.go](./map.go) file to see a proper implementation of generics with a struct.

Don't forget to modify the test file!
